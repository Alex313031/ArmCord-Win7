</div>

# Features

- **Standalone client** 

   ArmCord is built as standalone client, it doesn't rely on original Discord client.


- **Various mods built in**
 
   Explore Cumcord/GooseMod/Flicker plugins and their features!


- **Made for Privacy**

   ArmCord automatically blocks Discord's trackers.


- **Faster than normal Discord app**

   ArmCord is using newer Electron than stock Discord app. This usually means increased performance and more stable experience.


- **Designed to work anywhere**

   ArmCord was initially created in mind to run on Arm64 Linux devices. We soon expanded our support to more platforms. We plan to support every platform that [Electron supports](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/support#supported-platforms).
